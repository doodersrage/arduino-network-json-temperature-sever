# Arduino networked dual temperature probe

Arduino Uno, Arduino Ethernet Shield, 2x16 char LCD panel with pot for contrast, and dual averaged temperature probes with JSON formatted results. 

Uses libraries:\
SPI.h\
Ethernet.h\
LiquidCrystal.h\
ArduinoJson.h   (https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/arduinojson/)

Will add wireing diagram at some point.
